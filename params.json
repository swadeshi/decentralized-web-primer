It's an exciting, time of open, global innovation and experimentation.  Educate yourself and join in.\r\n\r\n### Background/Inspiration\r\n\r\nTo understand the background and motivation for making the web of data distributed, read/watch the Internet Archive's Brewster Kahle call for us to [Lock the Web Open](http://blog.archive.org/2015/02/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/) and read flyingzumwalt's essay [The internet has been stolen from you.
