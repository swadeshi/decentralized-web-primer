## Activities

**[Replicating files](/distributed-web-primer/presentations/How Bit Torrent Replicates Files)**: How bit torrent uses hash tables to replicate files
while maintaining data integrity

 *TODO*: _Hash Trees (Merkle DAGs), Hash Tables and DHTs_ By default, Bit Torrent uses a Distributed Hash Table, not Hash Trees (Merkle DAGs). What's the difference? When does it matter?

**[Replicating changes to files and directories](/distributed-web-primer/presentations/How Hypercore Replicates Changes to Files)**: How hypercore Uses Merkle DAGs to Replicate Files that Change Over Time  

**[Git commits, trees and blobs](/distributed-web-primer/presentations/How Git Stores Data)**: How Git Uses Merkle DAGs to represent files, directories, and the history of changes to that those files & directories.

*TODO*: _Replicating ledgers as Blockchains_: How blockchain technologies like bitCoin and ethereum use Merkle DAGs to distribute ledgers of transactions.
