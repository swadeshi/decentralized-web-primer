## Conceptual Framework

A Merkle DAG is a tree of Cryptographic hashes. This module shows What that means and why it's useful.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain what it means to calculate a Hash Digest of content (ie. SHA1 or md5)
* Create Hash Digests for any digital content
* Explain how we use Hash Digests to verify the integrity of content
* Define the term "Merkle DAG"
* Draw the general structure of Merkle DAGs

## Activities

*TODO*: [Calculate Cryptographic Hashes of Content](activities/calculate-hashes)

*TODO*: [Use Cryptographic Hashes to Validate Content](activities/validate-content)  

*TODO*: [Build Trees of Hashes](activities/build-hash-trees)

*TODO*: Read _Where the term "Merkle DAG" comes from_
