## Conceptual Framework

_Explain_: A Merkle DAG is a tree of Cryptographic hashes. What does that mean and why is it useful?

## Learning Objectives

* What does it mean to calculate a Hash Digest of content (ie. SHA1 or md5)
* How can we use them to verify data integrity?
* What is a Hash Tree (aka Merkle DAG) and why is it useful?
* Why do we call Hash Trees "Merkle DAGs"?

## Activities

*TODO*: [Calculate Cryptographic Hashes of Content](activities/calculate-hashes)

*TODO*: [Use Cryptographic Hashes to Validate Content](activities/validate-content)  

*TODO*: [Build Trees of Hashes](activities/build-hash-trees)

*TODO*: Read _Where the term "Merkle DAG" comes from_
