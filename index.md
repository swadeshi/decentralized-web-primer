## This is a Work in Progress!

_**This is a Work in Progress!** creating a primer like this is a community effort. If you know about the topics outlined here, or think other information should be included here, [please contribute content!](https://github.com/swadeshi/decentralized-web-primer/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)_

## Participate in the Decentralized Web

This shift towards a decentralized web is a lot like the shift from mainframes to personal computers that happened in the 1980s and 1990s, which gave birth to the world wide web.  It's an exciting, time of open, global innovation and experimentation.  Educate yourself and join in.

There are some basics you need to understand in order to create technologies that ride this wave.  This primer is a collection of tutorials and presentations aimed at letting anyone get their head around these ideas and run with them.

## How to Use this Primer

## Background/Inspiration

Take it back, nonviolently.](https://medium.com/@flyingzumwalt/the-internet-has-been-stolen-from-you-take-it-back-nonviolently-248f8d445b87)
